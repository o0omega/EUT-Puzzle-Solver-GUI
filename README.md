## Puzzle explanations
- Puzzle #1:
A table presents set of random 25 numbers in range from 1 to 200 ordered randomly,
the goal is to go through them in ascending order.

- Puzzle #2:
Same as Puzzle #1, but numbers are masked behind their shifted counterparts on default desktop keyboard layout, so it goes as following:
! = 1, @ = 2, # = 3, $ = 4, % = 5, ^ = 6, & = 7, * = 8, ( = 9, ) = 0.

- Puzzle #3:
A table of 25 random numbers need to be translated from the base in () to base10 then pressed on from lowest to highest.

- Puzzle #4:
We are greeted with 25 ? signs each opens to be a math formula or an evil question that you need to solve.
Upon solving each of them you have to press on the answers from lowest to highest
(Thankfully, if you do a mistake a solved equation won't become unsolved).
