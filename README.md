## Puzzle explanations
- Puzzle #1:
A table presents set of random 25 numbers in range from 1 to 200 ordered randomly,
the goal is to go through them in ascending order.

- Puzzle #2:
Same as Puzzle #1, but numbers are masked behind their shifted counterparts on default desktop keyboard layout, so it goes as following:
! = 1, @ = 2, # = 3, $ = 4, % = 5, ^ = 6, & = 7, * = 8, ( = 9, ) = 0.

- Puzzle #3:
Values range is increased to 2500 and the goal is to find number of 1s (ones) for each number in their binary form (base 2) and go from lowest counts to highest.

- Puzzle #4:
We are greeted with 25 colors for which we are provided their RGB values. The goal is to convert RGB
values to HSV and find the sum of H+S+V and go from lowest sum to highest.
